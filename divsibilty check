#Write a Python program that takes an integer n as input and prints the sum of all numbers from 1 to n that are divisible by both 2 and 3. Use a for loop for this task.

n = int(input("Enter an integer n: "))
sum_divisible_by_2_and_3 = 0

# Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0 and i % 3 == 0:
        sum_divisible_by_2_and_3 += i

print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to {n} that are divisible by both 2 and 3 is: {sum_divisible_by_2_and_3}")
